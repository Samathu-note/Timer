# Countdown Timer and Stopwatch

This project features a **Countdown Timer** and a **Stopwatch** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The countdown timer allows users to set a time and count down until it reaches zero. The stopwatch lets users track elapsed time in real-time, with the ability to pause, resume, and reset.

## Features

- **Countdown Timer**:
  - Set the countdown time in minutes.
  - Start, pause, and reset the countdown timer.
  - Displays time in the format: `mm:ss:SS` (minutes:seconds:milliseconds).
  - Alerts the user when the countdown reaches zero.
  
- **Stopwatch**:
  - Tracks time starting from `00:00:00:00`.
  - Start, pause, resume, and reset the stopwatch.
  - Displays time in the format: `hh:mm:ss:SS` (hours:minutes:seconds:milliseconds).
  
## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to create the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Used to style the page and create a responsive, clean layout.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for the countdown timer and stopwatch functionality.
